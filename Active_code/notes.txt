The code is successfully running on my NVIDIA GPU.
However, I cannot get the accuracy to go above 40%
Possible solutions to try???
* change LSTM layer, I suspect it may be the problem
* if not, try changing the normalization scale
* what happens if I try processing them as images..?

changing optimizers is not working
changing activation functions hasnt been working either

make bulkflow vs bulkflow plot
only rotated cat of the same origin -- DONE

======
I want to try making all tensors the same size
and see how that affects processing time

RESULT: so far, I havent seen any improvements in performance when cutting off data.
it performs just as bad
======
i want to try making a really big model (with like 8 layers) and see what happens
I also want to test not normalizing the data. Since it's worked so well for prof. Ric's student. (which i still dont have an explanation for why...)

Back to work after a semi-break.
Made my first push to GitHub in months.

Some changes include adding Hume and Rachel's code. Might add Mohsen's code at some point as well but not now.

I also modified my rotation code to no longer do rotations, but i still run the data through it to keep it compatible with my model.
I also still want the data to be processed. This includes:
* adding error of 40% to the data to make it more realistic
* using distance mod instance of just distance for training the model
* filtering out the zone of avoidance
* organizing the data to make it easier and faster to process in the model (and to also deal with smaller files)
