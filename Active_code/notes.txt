The code is successfully running on my NVIDIA GPU.
However, I cannot get the accuracy to go above 40%
Possible solutions to try???
* change LSTM layer, I suspect it may be the problem
* if not, try changing the normalization scale
* what happens if I try processing them as images..?

changing optimizers is not working
changing activation functions hasnt been working either
