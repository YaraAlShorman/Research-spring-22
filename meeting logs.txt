Making mock catalogs for Machine learning (this is available on the shared drive folder)

April 4, 2022

The columns in the outer rim catalogs are x,y,z,vx,vy,vz, r, v, dv, glon, and
glat. Here r = sqrt(x^2+y^2+z^2) and v = sqrt(vx^2+vy^2+vz^2).

The catalogs don’t have any error so the error in the velocity dv = 0 for all 
of the objects. Once you’ve rotated the catalog, we need to generate the quantities 
that would be in a real catalog. This includes adding realistic measurement noise.  
Typical uncertainties in the distance modulus are around σμ = 0.4, so that
would probably be a good place to start. I’m imagining that we will start by
seeing if we can train a model with artificial data and have it predict the bulk
flow for a test set of artificial catalogs.
The quantities you should generate to make a realistic catalog are redshift
cz = Hor + v
where you should use Ho = 100km/s/Mpc (since distances are in h^−1 Mpc ), and distance modulus

μ = 5 log10(r) + 25 + δ

where δ is drawn from a Gaussian distribution centered on zero and with standard 
deviation σμ. All together, the catalogs should include cz, μ, σμ, glon, and glat. 
However, to start with we can use the same σμ for all the objects so we
won’t need to include it in the catalog data.

====================
TODO
====================
-------------------
sample the arrays
format the arrays
think about how to include the bulkflows (I am free to do whatever)
-------------------

MEETING NOTES
====================
--------------------
April 15 '22
--------------------
for each catalogue: (new formatting)
0-redshift
1-distance modulus
2-glon
3-glat
4-bx (bulkflow x component)
5-by (bulkflow y component)
6-bz (bulkflow z component)

--------------------
April 23 '22
--------------------
I realized in a moment of clarity that the above isnt right
New format:
0-redshift
1-distance modulus
2-glon
3-glat

bx, by and bz will be stored in the header of each array
