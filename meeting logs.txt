.npz files can contain multiple arrays, which can be indexed similar to how python
dictionaries works

consider the following:

    arrays = np.load('filename')

    # to access the bulkflows, use:
    bulkflows = arrays['header']  # this will return a 0x3 array with bx, by, bz

    # to access the data, use:
    data = arrays['data']  
    # this will return your usual 4-coloumned array of data, which is formatted as follows:

formatting of data:
0-redshift
1-distance modulus
2-glon
3-glat

bx, by and bz will be stored in a header array for every file

files will be saved as .npy.npz, which is an archive file format (tha can be compressed)
so it takes less space, but it still works just fine.
My computer also processes it much quicker
