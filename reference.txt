Here are the correct columns for the outerrim LG catalogs:
=================
0 - x (coords)
1 - y (coords)
2 - z (coords)
3 - vx (true velocity)
4 - vy (true velocity)
5 - vz (true velocity)
6 - cz (redshift (km/s))
7 - r (actual distance (Mpc/h))
8 - vr (radial velocity)
9 - sigma vr (error in vr)
10 - glon (galactic longitude)
11 - glat (galactic latitude)
=================
r = (sqrt(x^2+y^2+z^2))
vr = cz - 100 * r
cz = (100)*r + vr 
=================
Mpc: Mega parsecs (10^6 parsecs)
h is the uncertainity in the hubble constant
where x,y,z are coordinates
vx,vy,vz are true velocity components

.npy.npz files can contain multiple arrays, which can be indexed similar to how python
dictionaries works

consider the following:

    arrays = np.load('filename')

    # to access the bulkflows, use:
    bulkflows = arrays['header']  # this will return a 0x3 array with bx, by, bz

    # to access the data, use:
    data = arrays['data']  
    # this will return your usual 4-coloumned array of data, which is formatted as follows:

formatting of data:
0-redshift
1-distance modulus
2-glon
3-glat

then you can access each column by using: data[: ,i]

bx, by and bz will be stored in a header array for every file

files will be saved as .npy.npz, which is an archive file format (that can be compressed)
so it takes less space, but it still works just fine.
My computer also processes it much quicker

I mainly did this to keep the bulkflows and the corresponding data in the same file.
